There are multiple types of formatting methods supported in the newer python versions, namely 
1. Old style formatting(% operator)
2. New style formatting(str.format)
3. String interpolation / f-Strings
The fastest and best method is the 3rd one (f-Strings), but it is only available in Python 3.6+ versions. Also as recommended by the official Python documentation, we will stick with New style formatting instead of the Old style formatting.
```
“The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries correctly). Using the newer formatted string literals or the str.format() interface helps avoid these errors. These alternatives also provide more powerful, flexible and extensible approaches to formatting text.” ([Source](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=sprintf#printf-style-string-formatting))
```
### The format() method
1. Concatenate variables (of any data type) into strings using format method.
```python
name = "Ritik"
number = len(name) * 3
print("Hello {} your lucky number is {}".format(name, number))		#Whatever you pass into format would be concatenated to the string
print("Hello {} your lucky number is {}".format('Ritik', 15))
print("Hello {1} your lucky number is {0}".format(number, name))	#Argument passed in format() at index 0 is concatenated at the place specified by {0}
print("Hello {name} your lucky number is {num}".format(name=name, num=number)			#Here, the order doesn't matters
Hello Ritik your lucky number is 15			#Output of all of the above print lines
```
```python
print('The first {p} was alright, but the {p} {p} was tough.'.format(p = 'second'))
The first second was alright, but the second second was tough.		#Output
```

2. Use formatting operations to output text
```python
price = 7.5
with_tax = price * 0.9
print("Base price: ${:.2f}. With Tax: ${:.2f}".format(price, with_tax))
Base price: $7.50. With Tax: $8.18			#Output
```
**EXPLAINATION**
Lest's break the formatting part '{:.2f}'. The three parts are (':', '.2', 'f')
1. : - A colon seperates the formatting expression with field name/placeholder.
2. .2 - It specifies the number of digits to output after decimal place or in case of string, the number of characters.
3. f - It specifies the type of value, which in this case if floating point numbers or float. Apart from float some other values that can be used are:
-   **‘d’** for integers
-   **‘f’** for floating-point numbers
-   **‘b’** for binary numbers
-   **‘o’** for octal numbers
-   **‘x’** for octal hexadecimal numbers
-   **‘s’** for string
-   **‘e’** for floating-point in an exponent format

EXAMPLE
"Hello {name:.2s}".format(name=name) is same as "Hello {:.2s}".format(name).		# Notice no placeholder.
"Hello {:.2s}".format(name) outputs only 2 characters of the
```python
name = "Ritik"
number = len(name) * 3
print("Hello {name:.2s} your lucky number is {num}".format(name=name, num=number))
print("Hello {name:.2s} your lucky number is {num}".format(name=name, num=number))
```
