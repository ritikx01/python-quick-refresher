## Comparing things
1.
```python
print(10>1)
# True					#Output
```
2.
```python
print("cat" == "dog")	#Equality operator
# False					#Output
```
3.
```python
print(1 != 2)			#Not equals operator
# True					#Output
```
4.
```python
print(1 < "1")			#TypeError because of the operation between two different data types i.e Integer and String
# TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'					#Output
```
5.
```python
print(1 == "1")		#No TypeError because owe just asked if both are equal or not
# False					#Output
```

## Boolean
One of two possible states: Either `True` or `False`

## Logical Operators
Logical operators in python are (and, or, not). We can use these to connect multiple statements and perform more complex comparisons.
1. 'AND' operator
`print(7 > 6 and 2 > 3)`
Output: `False`			# Both statements need to be true
2. 'OR operaror
3. '
